## External services used
- The website [lingojam.com](https://lingojam.com/ItalicTextGenerator) was used for creating text in different fonts.
- For drawing most of the menu [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) did a great job, on serving as a documentation on [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters).
- The library [Ncalc](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc) takes the heavy lifting of evaluating any mathematical expressions within `Kahoofection`. Thanks! :)
