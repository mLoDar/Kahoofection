`Kahoofection` is a console based application, which uses Selenium for a variety of tasks related to the game/learning plattform [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/).

`As of 11.February.2025 the project is still work in progress and still a lot needs to be accomplished in order to finish this application, so be patient ;)`
